        description : "We look at how an intelligent agent solves new problems. Starting with blind search we quickly move on to heuristic search, and look at several variations designed to combat the combinatorial explosion that search has to face. We study how board games like Chess and Go are played; how search facilitates logical reasoning; and approaches to domain independent planning of actions to achieve a goal. We end with looking at an alternative formulation that combines search and reasoning as constraint processing." ,
